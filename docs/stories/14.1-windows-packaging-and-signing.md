# Epic 14 — Packaging & Auto-Update

## Status
In Progress

## Story
**As a** product owner,
**I want** a Windows-first packaging and signing pipeline,
**so that** CrocoVoice can be installed and trusted by external users.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Packaging tool is selected and documented (with rationale and constraints).
2. Windows installer artifacts are produced (exe/msi) with consistent versioning.
3. App is signed with a valid Windows certificate (or documented interim workflow if unavailable).
4. Build configuration includes app identity (name, id, icon, version, publisher).
5. Packaging output is reproducible via a single command (local) and CI-ready.
6. No regressions in core app launch and recording flow on Windows.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Evaluate Electron packaging options and select the preferred tool (AC: 1)
- [x] Configure Windows build targets, app identity, and versioning (AC: 2,4)
- [x] Integrate Windows signing (or document interim unsigned flow) (AC: 3)
- [x] Add build command(s) and document usage (AC: 5)
- [ ] Smoke test packaged build on Windows (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Windows-first per product brief; macOS can follow in 14.2/14.3 as needed.
- Keep changes minimal; avoid refactors unrelated to packaging.

### Testing
- Manual (Windows): install, launch, record, deliver text, quit/relaunch.
