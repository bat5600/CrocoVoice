# Epic 10 — Telemetry and Quality Metrics

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product owner,
**I want** quality metrics captured per dictation,
**so that** we can measure reliability and improve the pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. History stores e2e latency, network latency (if applicable), and fallback usage reason.
2. Divergence score between raw and formatted text is computed and stored.
3. Metrics are visible in a diagnostics or quality panel.
4. Telemetry export is opt-in and redacts sensitive content.
5. Metrics capture does not block dictation completion.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add metric fields to history schema (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Compute divergence score after formatting (AC: 2)
- [x] Add quality metrics UI in diagnostics or hub (AC: 3)
- [x] Add opt-in telemetry export with redaction (AC: 4)
- [x] Ensure metrics capture is async and non-blocking (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Avoid storing raw audio unless explicitly enabled.
- Keep metric computation lightweight to avoid latency.
- Recommended metric fields: `latency_ms`, `network_latency_ms`, `fallback_reason`, `divergence_score`.

### Testing
- Unit: divergence score calculation.
- Manual: verify metrics in UI and opt-in behavior.
