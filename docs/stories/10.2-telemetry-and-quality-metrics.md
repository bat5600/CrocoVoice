# Epic 10 — Telemetry and Quality Metrics

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** product owner,
**I want** quality metrics captured per dictation,
**so that** we can measure reliability and improve the pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. History stores e2e latency, network latency (if applicable), and fallback usage.
2. Divergence score between raw and formatted text is computed and stored.
3. Metrics are visible in a diagnostics or quality panel.
4. Telemetry export is opt-in and redacts sensitive content.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add metric fields to history schema (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Compute divergence score after formatting (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add quality metrics UI in diagnostics or hub (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add opt-in telemetry export with redaction (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Avoid storing raw audio unless explicitly enabled.
- Keep metric computation lightweight to avoid latency.

### Testing
- Unit: divergence score calculation.
- Manual: verify metrics in UI and opt-in behavior.
