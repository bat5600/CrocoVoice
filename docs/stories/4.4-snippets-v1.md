# Epic 4 — Snippets v1 (voice cues → templates)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** Snippets where a short voice cue maps to a reusable text template,  
**so that** I can insert common phrases/structures quickly while dictating.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. I can create, list, and delete snippets from the dashboard.
2. Each snippet has: a “cue” (what I say) and a “template” (what gets inserted), plus an optional description.
3. Snippet matching rules are simple and documented (v1): exact match or prefix match on the cue after normalization (trim + case-insensitive).
4. When a dictation starts with a matching cue, the cue is removed from the delivered text and replaced by the template.
5. User-friendly template behavior (v1 recommendation): support a single placeholder `{{content}}` that expands to the remaining spoken text (after removing the cue). If `{{content}}` is not present, append the remaining content at the end.
6. Snippet behavior is safe: if multiple matches exist, apply the most specific match; if uncertain, do nothing.
7. Snippets work offline (SQLite source of truth); if sync is enabled, changes are queued and non-blocking.
8. Cue normalization is consistent across inputs (trim, collapse whitespace, lowercase, strip trailing punctuation).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add SQLite storage for snippets (create/list/delete) (AC: 1,2,7)
- [x] Add dashboard UI for managing snippets (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Implement cue matching + replacement in main dictation pipeline (AC: 3,4,5,6)
- [x] Ensure behavior is consistent across delivery targets (type/paste/clipboard and Notes target) (AC: 4,7)
- [x] Implement cue normalization utility used both in UI and pipeline (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes
- Likely new table in `store.js` and new IPC handlers in `main.js`.
- Apply snippet expansion in main process after transcription post-process and before delivery; recommended order for best UX:
  1) LLM post-process (cleanup/punctuation)
  2) Snippet expansion (cue → template, `{{content}}`)
  3) Dictionary corrections
  4) Persist + deliver
- Keep matching rules conservative to avoid surprising replacements.

### Testing
- Manual: add snippet, speak cue-only, cue+extra text, non-matching, overlapping cues, multiple snippets.
- Offline: verify snippets still apply with no network.
