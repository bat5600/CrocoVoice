# Epic 10 — Notifications Inbox

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** product notifications in an inbox and via OS alerts,
**so that** I stay informed without missing updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remote notifications are fetched and stored locally with read/archived states.
2. Local OS notifications are shown for high-priority events.
3. Users can disable notifications globally and per type.
4. Notifications never include sensitive transcript content by default.
5. Inbox supports a retention window (default: 30 days) and purge old items.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add local notifications inbox UI (AC: 1,3)
- [ ] Add remote notifications storage and sync (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add OS notification integration with opt-out (AC: 2,3)
- [ ] Ensure notification payloads avoid sensitive content (AC: 4)
- [ ] Add retention policy and purge job (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Notifications can use Supabase table or a lightweight backend endpoint.
- Keep retention window configurable.
- Store notification types explicitly to enable per-type toggles.

### Testing
- Manual: send test notifications, mark read/archived, toggle opt-out.
