# Epic 10 — Notifications Inbox

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** product notifications in an inbox and via OS alerts,
**so that** I stay informed without missing updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remote notifications are fetched and stored locally with read/archived states.
2. Local OS notifications are shown for high-priority events.
3. Users can disable notifications globally and per type.
4. Notifications never include sensitive transcript content by default.
5. Inbox supports a retention window (default: 30 days) and purge old items.

## Tasks / Subtasks
