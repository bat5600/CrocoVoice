# Epic 12 — CrocOmni UI and Storage

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a CrocOmni assistant with conversation history,
**so that** I can revisit and continue my assistant sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CrocOmni has a conversation view with user/assistant roles.
2. Conversations can be started, resumed, and archived locally.
3. Local storage persists conversations across restarts.
4. Messages can be added to a conversation without requiring context capture.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add CrocOmni conversation storage (local SQLite) (AC: 2,3)
- [x] Add CrocOmni UI in the hub (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Implement conversation list + detail view (AC: 1,2,3)
- [x] Wire message send/receive to existing AI provider (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Use a dedicated table: crocomni_history(conversation_id, role, content, created_at) and a conversations table for titles/archival.
- Context injection, opt-in controls, and redaction are handled in Story 12.2.

### Testing
- Manual: create conversation, continue, archive, verify persistence after restart.
