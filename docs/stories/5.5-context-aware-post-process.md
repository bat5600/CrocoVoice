# Epic 5 — Context-Aware Post-Process

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the post-process to use redacted context hints,
**so that** proper nouns are corrected more accurately without privacy surprises.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When context capture is enabled and context-aware post-process is on, the post-process prompt includes redacted app/window/url hints.
2. When context capture is disabled or context-aware post-process is off, no context hints are sent.
3. Redaction applies to app/window/url before any OpenAI request (emails, phones, long numbers).
4. A global toggle in the Context view enables/disables context-aware post-process.
5. Context capture failures do not block post-process.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add context-aware post-process toggle to settings/UI (AC: 4)
- [x] Inject redacted context hints into post-process prompt (AC: 1,2,3,5)

## Dev Notes
- Use only app/window/url signals as hints (no ax/textbox/screenshot).
- Keep hints short (truncate long titles, use URL domain only).
- Reuse existing redaction rules and never send raw context.

### Testing
- Manual: toggle on/off and verify behavior remains stable; disable context and confirm no context is used.
