# Epic 11 — Onboarding Flow (Resume + First Success)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a guided onboarding flow that I can resume,
**so that** I can complete setup and get my first successful dictation quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Onboarding includes: permissions (mic + accessibility/automation), mic test, hotkey setup, and a first dictation success step.
2. Progress is persisted locally and can be resumed after restart.
3. Each step has a clear pass/fail state with actionable guidance on failure.
4. Users can skip non-critical steps (e.g., tips/use-cases) and still finish onboarding.
5. Completion state is reflected in settings and is idempotent (re-running does not break state).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build onboarding wizard with step state machine + persistence (AC: 1,2,5)
- [x] Implement permission checks + remediation UI hooks (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add mic test flow with pass/fail and retry (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add hotkey setup/validation step (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add first-dictation success step (record -> deliver) (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add skip logic for non-critical steps (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Store onboarding state locally in settings (e.g., `onboarding.step`, `onboarding.completedAt`).
- Reuse diagnostics signals from Epic 7 for permission failures.
- Keep the flow robust to missing permissions (do not block app usage, but flag completion as partial).

### Testing
- Manual: complete onboarding from scratch, simulate failure for mic/accessibility, resume after restart.
- Manual: skip optional steps, verify completion status and settings updates.
