# Epic 11 — Onboarding Flow (Resume + First Success)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a guided onboarding flow that I can resume,
**so that** I can complete setup and get my first successful dictation quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Onboarding includes: permissions (mic + accessibility/automation), mic test, hotkey setup, and a first dictation success step.
2. Progress is persisted locally and can be resumed after restart.
3. Each step has a clear pass/fail state with actionable guidance on failure.
4. Users can skip non-critical steps (e.g., tips/use-cases) and still finish onboarding.
5. Completion state is reflected in settings and is idempotent (re-running does not break state).
6. Mic selection is functional: device list is populated (or clear “none detected” state), selection works, and “Audio detected” messaging cannot contradict “No mic detected”.
7. Onboarding is not blocked by broken mic dropdown UI; the “Continue” button enables only when requirements are satisfied, with clear guidance otherwise.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Build onboarding wizard with step state machine + persistence (AC: 1,2,5)
- [x] Implement permission checks + remediation UI hooks (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add mic test flow with pass/fail and retry (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add hotkey setup/validation step (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add first-dictation success step (record -> deliver) (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Add skip logic for non-critical steps (AC: 4)
- [x] Fix mic selector dropdown population + selection (and unify with settings) (AC: 6,7)
- [x] Fix contradictory mic detection copy/state (“audio detected” vs “no mic”) (AC: 6,7)

## Dev Notes
- Store onboarding state locally in settings (e.g., `onboarding.step`, `onboarding.completedAt`).
- Reuse diagnostics signals from Epic 7 for permission failures.
- Keep the flow robust to missing permissions (do not block app usage, but flag completion as partial).

### Testing
- Manual: complete onboarding from scratch, simulate failure for mic/accessibility, resume after restart.
- Manual: skip optional steps, verify completion status and settings updates.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
GPT-5 (Codex CLI)

### Debug Log References
- node test-core.js

### Completion Notes List
- Added hotkey onboarding step with capture + persistence.
- Ensured onboarding state machine persists and can be reset/resumed.
- Kept permission, mic test, dictation, and delivery checks wired through onboarding UI.
- Synced microphone list from widget to dashboard, with fallback and shared selection logic.
- Prevented "no mic" copy from overriding detected audio; continue now gates on signal readiness.
- Manual onboarding flows not run in this environment (UI-only).
- Hotkey step now marks ready when an existing shortcut is present so Continue works without changing it.
- Local model onboarding step now refreshes available models on entry.

### File List
- dashboard.js
- main.js
- preload.js
- renderer.js
