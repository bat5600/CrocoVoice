# Epic 4 — History Metadata and Quality Metrics

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** history entries to retain raw/formatted/edited text and quality metrics,
**so that** I can understand output quality and track improvements over time.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each history entry stores `raw_text`, `formatted_text`, and `edited_text` (nullable if not produced).
2. Each entry stores quality metrics: `latency_ms`, `divergence_score`, `language`, and `mic_device`.
3. Metadata is persisted locally and remains available offline; if sync is enabled, metadata is included in the sync payload.
4. Metrics collection never blocks dictation or delivery, and failures fall back to safe defaults.
5. No sensitive content is uploaded without explicit user consent (metrics and metadata only).
6. Fallback path is recorded (streaming vs file upload vs local inference).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Extend the history table/schema to include text stages and metrics (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Capture metrics during the pipeline and persist with history entries (AC: 2,4)
- [x] Ensure sync payload includes metadata without blocking (AC: 3)
- [x] Guard metrics capture with privacy toggles (AC: 5)
- [x] Add fallback path field and populate on completion (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- `divergence_score` can be a simple edit distance ratio between raw and formatted text (v1).
- Keep defaults when metrics are unavailable (e.g., `latency_ms = null`).

### Testing
- Manual: verify history rows contain multiple text stages and metrics after dictation.
- Offline: ensure metadata persists and can be viewed without network.
