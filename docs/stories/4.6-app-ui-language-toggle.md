# Epic 4 — App UI Language Toggle (English default + French option)

## Status
Ready

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** the app UI to be 100% English by default with a settings toggle to switch to French,  
**so that** the UI is consistent and understandable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Default UI language is **English** (no French strings appear in English mode).
2. A Settings control lets me switch UI language between **English** and **French**.
3. UI language preference is **per-device** and persists across restarts.
4. Switching UI language updates the UI **without requiring an app restart**.
5. UI language is separate from transcription/dictation language settings (no functional coupling).
6. Coverage (v1): dashboard/hub, onboarding, diagnostics, toasts, and the status bubble/context menu.
7. Missing translations fall back to English (and are easy to discover during dev).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define a minimal i18n mechanism (dictionary + helper) suitable for the current codebase (JS/CommonJS).
- [ ] Add `settings.uiLanguage` (or equivalent) and wire it to UI rendering.
- [ ] Replace hard-coded user-visible strings in the covered surfaces with i18n keys.
- [ ] Ensure language toggle updates already-open views without restart (re-render / refresh).
- [ ] Manual pass: verify there is no mixed EN/FR in English mode.

## Dev Notes
- Keep scope to UI strings only; do not change transcription language features.
- Prefer an incremental approach: start with the high-visibility surfaces and expand later.

### Testing
- Manual: toggle EN/FR while dashboard is open; verify immediate change; restart app; verify persistence.
- Manual: check status bubble/context menu strings update as well.
