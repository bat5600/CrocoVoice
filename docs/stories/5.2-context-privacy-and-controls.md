# Epic 5 - Context Privacy and Controls

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear privacy controls for contextual awareness,
**so that** I can enable or disable it confidently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A global toggle enables/disables contextual awareness across the app.
2. Users can override behavior per app (force on/off or choose a profile).
3. The UI explains which signals are used (app/window/url/ax/screenshot) and their defaults.
4. Sensitive signals (ax/textbox, screenshot) are opt-in and off by default.
5. Disabling contextual awareness preserves the standard formatting pipeline.
6. Settings changes apply immediately and persist locally.
7. Per-app overrides can be set to: inherit global, force off, or force on with a specific profile.
8. The settings UI clearly shows what will be captured for the active app.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add global contextual awareness toggle to settings (AC: 1,4,5)
- [ ] Add per-app overrides in profile settings (AC: 2,5)
- [ ] Add privacy copy explaining signals and data handling (AC: 3,4)
- [ ] Ensure toggles affect the pipeline at runtime (AC: 5,6)
- [ ] Add per-app override modes (inherit/off/on + profile) (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add active-app preview of enabled signals (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes
- Default to minimal context (app/window/url). Sensitive signals require opt-in.
- Keep language clear and non-technical in the UI.
- Store overrides in settings with a stable key (e.g., `context.overrides[appId]`).

### Testing
- Manual: toggle global switch and confirm formatting reverts to default.
- Manual: per-app override supersedes global setting.
