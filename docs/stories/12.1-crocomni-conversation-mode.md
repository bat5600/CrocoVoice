# Epic 12 — CrocOmni (CrocOmni Assistant)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a CrocOmni assistant with conversation history and context,
**so that** I can get richer, context-aware help while dictating.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CrocOmni has a conversation view with user/assistant roles.
2. Conversations store app, url, and optional context signals per message.
3. Context usage is opt-in and can be disabled per app.
4. Conversations can be started, resumed, and archived locally.
5. CrocOmni requests go through the existing AI provider with redaction safeguards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add CrocOmni conversation storage (local SQLite) (AC: 1,4)
- [ ] Add CrocOmni UI in the hub (AC: 1,4)
- [ ] Implement context injection with opt-in controls (AC: 2,3)
- [ ] Add redaction/filters for sensitive content (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Use a dedicated table: crocomni_history(conversation_id, role, content, app, url, ax_text, screenshot_ref, created_at).
- Keep default context minimal unless user opts in.

### Testing
- Manual: create conversation, continue, archive, verify context toggles.
