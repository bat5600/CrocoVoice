# Patch Story — No Speech / No Placeholder Transcript (Regression)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** the app to never generate fake/placeholder transcript text when no speech is detected,  
**so that** my clipboard/history/notes are not polluted with nonsense.

## Background
Video review reports that when there is no text/audio, the app outputs a “fake transcript” (placeholder text). This is a trust-breaking failure mode and must be handled as “no speech/no audio”.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. If no audio is captured (or capture times out), the UI shows a clear “No audio / No speech detected” message and **no transcript is produced** (no paste/type/clipboard insert).
2. If ASR returns empty/whitespace or known filler/hallucination strings, treat it as “no speech” and do not emit a transcript.
3. No History entry and no Note is created for “no speech” outcomes.
4. App returns to idle cleanly after the warning (no stuck “processing” state).
5. Existing IPC channels remain stable (no breaking changes).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Identify the current code path producing placeholder/fake text when ASR output is empty.
- [ ] Centralize “no speech” detection (empty + filler patterns) and short-circuit the pipeline safely.
- [ ] Ensure no persistence occurs for no-speech (history/notes/last transcript).
- [ ] Add a minimal manual regression script (silence input, muted mic, short noise).

## Dev Notes
- There is a prior implemented story in `docs/stories/done/1.10.alerter-absence-audio-et-supprimer-faux-texte.md`; this patch story is for a regression or missed edge-case.

### Testing
- Manual: run dictation with muted mic/silence, confirm warning and zero text insertion.
- Manual: simulate ASR returning empty string and known filler text.
