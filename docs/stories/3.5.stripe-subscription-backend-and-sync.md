# Stripe Subscription Backend and Sync - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a user,
I want a reliable PRO purchase and subscription management flow,
So that my access is updated automatically and persists across sessions.

## Status
Draft

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Supabase auth + Stripe Checkout/Portal + webhook updates
- Technology: Electron (main/renderer), JS, Supabase Edge Functions (recommended), Stripe API
- Follows pattern: CTA button -> web flow -> status badge -> sync
- Touch points: dashboard subscription UI, quota gating, sync service, Supabase user settings

## Missing Pieces (Current Gaps)

- No backend endpoint to create/reuse Stripe Customer or Checkout/Portal sessions.
- No webhook handler to persist subscription status in Supabase.
- No authoritative subscription data source in Supabase (only local settings).
- No deterministic mapping between Supabase user id/email and Stripe customer.
- No professional validation (webhook signature, idempotency, event replay).

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. "Passer Pro" calls a backend endpoint that returns a Stripe Checkout URL; the app opens it.
2. Stripe customer is created or reused deterministically for the authenticated user (Supabase user id/email).
3. Stripe webhook updates subscription status in Supabase on checkout/subscription events.
4. The app displays PRO immediately after the webhook update (manual "Actualiser" or auto-refresh).
5. "Gerer mon abonnement" opens the Stripe customer portal via backend.
6. No Stripe secret keys are exposed to the Electron app.

**Integration Requirements:**
7. Subscription state is persisted in Supabase and survives app restarts.
8. Quota gating uses subscription status (`active` or `trialing`) to unlock unlimited dictation.
9. Login/signup/reset flows remain unchanged.

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Manual verification steps are documented and executed.
11. Webhook signature verification is enforced.
12. Idempotency is handled for repeated webhook events.

## Architecture Decision (Recommended)

- **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions (auth via JWT, secrets in Supabase).
- **Storage:** Dedicated `subscriptions` table in Supabase (cleaner than `user_settings`).
- **Client Sync:** SyncService reads subscription record and stores a local `settings.subscription` snapshot.

If you prefer faster delivery, fallback to storing `subscription` inside `user_settings` and reuse the existing sync path.

## Technical Notes

- **Supabase table (recommended):**
  - `subscriptions` (PK: `user_id`)
  - Fields: `user_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `status`, `plan`, `price_id`,
    `current_period_end`, `updated_at`
  - RLS: user can `select` own row; only service role can `insert/update`.

- **Stripe endpoints (Edge Functions):**
  - `POST /stripe/checkout`
    - Auth required (Supabase JWT)
    - Lookup `subscriptions.user_id`
    - If missing `stripe_customer_id`, create customer with metadata
    - Create Checkout Session with `customer`, `client_reference_id`
    - Return `url`
  - `POST /stripe/portal`
    - Auth required
    - Create portal session with `customer`
    - Return `url`
  - `POST /stripe/webhook`
    - Verify signature
    - Handle `checkout.session.completed`,
      `customer.subscription.created|updated|deleted`
    - Upsert subscription row

- **App changes:**
  - Replace direct `STRIPE_CHECKOUT_URL` / `STRIPE_PORTAL_URL` usage with backend calls.
  - Add a subscription refresh path to read Supabase source-of-truth.
  - Use `status in {active, trialing}` as PRO entitlement.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. **Supabase Schema**
   - Create `subscriptions` table + RLS policies.
   - Add SQL migration file or documented setup steps.

2. **Edge Functions (Backend)**
   - Implement `stripe/checkout`, `stripe/portal`, `stripe/webhook`.
   - Store Stripe secret key + webhook secret in Supabase secrets.
   - Add idempotency guard (event id tracking or upsert by timestamp).

3. **Sync + Local State**
   - Extend `SyncService` to fetch `subscriptions` and store `settings.subscription`.
   - Update `dashboard:data` payload to include subscription state.

4. **App UI + Gating**
   - Ensure dashboard shows plan status from Supabase-driven state.
   - Ensure quota uses PRO entitlement (`active`/`trialing`) to unlock unlimited.

5. **Documentation**
   - Update README with required Stripe env/config.
   - Document webhook setup + required Stripe events.

6. **Manual Verification**
   - Checkout success path -> PRO status appears.
   - Portal access works.
   - Subscription cancellation -> PRO revoked.
   - Webhook replay/idempotency test.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Backend endpoints deployed and authenticated
- [ ] Webhook signature verification in place
- [ ] Subscription status stored in Supabase and synced to app
- [ ] PRO access depends on subscription status
- [ ] Manual verification checklist completed
- [ ] No regression in auth/sync/quotas

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Subscription mismatch between Stripe and app state.
- **Mitigation:** Webhook as source of truth + idempotent upserts.
- **Rollback:** Disable checkout CTA and keep FREE mode only.

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [ ] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple
