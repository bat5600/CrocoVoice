# Epic 14 — Packaging & Auto-Update

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** release manager,
**I want** a repeatable release pipeline with rollback,
**so that** updates are safe, auditable, and recoverable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CI pipeline builds signed Windows artifacts and publishes them to a release location.
2. Update feed/manifest is generated per release with version + checksum.
3. Release notes and versioning policy are documented.
4. Rollback runbook is documented and validated (latest-to-previous release).
5. Manual update fallback path is documented for users.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define release artifact storage and update feed generation (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Add CI steps for packaging/signing/publishing (AC: 1)
- [ ] Document versioning + release notes process (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create rollback runbook (AC: 4)
- [ ] Document manual update fallback (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Keep secrets in CI only; no keys in repo.
- Align with `docs/release-plan.md` Gate C requirements.

### Testing
- Manual: dry-run pipeline and verify update feed contents.
