# Epic 6 — Exports v1

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to export transcriptions in common formats,
**so that** I can share and reuse results outside CrocoVoice.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. I can export a transcript as `txt`, `md`, or `json`.
2. Exports optionally include timestamps (per segment or per paragraph).
3. Export works for both live dictations and file uploads.
4. Exports run locally and do not upload data without consent.
5. Export uses a save dialog with a sensible default filename (`{date}-{title}.{ext}`).
6. Exports exclude sensitive context fields by default (ax/textbox/screenshot) unless explicitly enabled.
7. Export failures show clear error messages and do not crash the app.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add export actions in history detail view (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Implement export formatters (txt/md/json) (AC: 1)
- [x] Add optional timestamp inclusion (AC: 2)
- [x] Ensure exports are local-only and privacy-safe (AC: 4)
- [x] Add save dialog with default filename (AC: 5)
- [x] Exclude sensitive context by default (AC: 6)
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- JSON export should include metadata (app, date, language, duration, source).
- Timestamp granularity can be coarse (e.g., per paragraph) for v1.
- Keep export format stable for future versioning (add `export_version` in JSON).

### Testing
- Manual: export from a live dictation and from an uploaded file.
- Manual: verify timestamp toggle on/off.
