# Epic 6 — Upload Flow and Status (Local File Transcription)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to upload a long audio file and see processing progress,
**so that** I can transcribe recordings without live dictation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The app lets me select a local audio file (wav/mp3/m4a) for transcription.
2. Processing is local by default (no upload); cloud fallback requires explicit opt-in.
3. A progress UI shows stages (queued, processing, completed, failed) and percent where possible.
4. I can cancel a running transcription without crashing the app.
5. Completed transcripts are saved in history with file metadata (name, duration, size).
6. Failures show a clear reason and preserve the original file reference locally.
7. Large files are handled with a configurable size limit (default: 200MB) and clear error messaging.
8. Transcription runs in a background job and does not block the UI thread.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add file picker entry point in hub (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement local file transcription pipeline (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add progress/status tracking and UI updates (AC: 3)
- [ ] Implement cancel flow and cleanup (AC: 4)
- [ ] Persist transcript + metadata in history (AC: 5,6)
- [ ] Add opt-in cloud fallback toggle and gating (AC: 2)
- [ ] Enforce size limits and user-friendly errors (AC: 7)
- [ ] Run transcription as a background job (AC: 8)

## Dev Notes
- Local processing should prefer on-device Whisper if available; otherwise fail with a clear message unless cloud fallback is enabled.
- Store a reference to the original file path (local-only) and avoid uploading it without consent.
- Default size limit should be configurable via settings.

### Testing
- Manual: upload small/large files, cancel mid-way, verify history entry.
- Offline: verify local-only path; cloud fallback remains disabled.
