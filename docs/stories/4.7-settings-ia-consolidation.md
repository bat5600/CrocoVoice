# Epic 4 — Settings IA Consolidation (Profile + Billing + Settings)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** Profile and Billing to be consolidated with Settings inside the app with clear sub-navigation,  
**so that** I can find account and transcription settings easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. There is a single entry point in the hub/dashboard (in-app) for Settings/Account management (no separate Electron window).
2. The Settings surface includes sub-navigation (e.g., horizontal tabs) for: Profile, Billing, Transcription, and Advanced (exact naming can be adjusted).
3. Existing settings remain accessible (no lost controls); underlying setting keys remain stable.
4. Billing actions (upgrade/manage subscription) remain available and keep existing loading/error UX patterns.
5. Navigation is keyboard-accessible and does not introduce layout flashes/jumps.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Decide IA labels and tab order (keep it minimal; avoid introducing new concepts).
- [ ] Refactor dashboard/hub Settings UI into a consolidated surface with sub-tabs.
- [ ] Move Profile + Billing entry points into this surface (preserve deep links where possible).
- [ ] Verify no regressions for existing settings behaviors and persistence.

## Dev Notes
- This is primarily an information architecture + UI refactor (no new business logic required).
- Keep the change additive where possible: preserve existing routing/state and refactor incrementally.

### Testing
- Manual: navigate between tabs; verify settings persist; verify billing buttons still work and show loading.
