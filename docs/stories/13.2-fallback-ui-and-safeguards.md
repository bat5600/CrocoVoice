# Epic 13 — Fallback UI and Safeguards

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear UI indicators and safe fallback behavior,
**so that** I understand when local inference is active and can trust results.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The UI indicates which inference path is active (local vs cloud).
2. If local inference fails or is unavailable, the system falls back to cloud ASR (if allowed) without data loss.
3. CPU safeguards are enforced (max duration, throttling) to prevent app freezes.
4. Users can switch off local inference and return to cloud-only mode.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add UI indicator for inference path (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement fallback logic and error handling (AC: 2)
- [x] Add CPU/time safeguards for local inference (AC: 3)
- [x] Add user-facing toggle for local inference (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Safeguards should favor stability over accuracy (abort local job if thresholds exceeded).
- Fallback should respect privacy settings (do not upload if cloud is disabled).

### Testing
- Manual: force local inference failure and verify fallback behavior.
- Manual: toggle local inference off and confirm cloud-only mode.
