# Epic 8 — Streaming Transport Contract and Reliability

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a clear streaming protocol and reliability rules,
**so that** the low-latency pipeline is stable and debuggable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A WebSocket streaming protocol is specified (message types, ordering, error codes).
2. Optional Opus encoding is supported and negotiated; PCM fallback remains available.
3. The client implements heartbeat (ping/pong) and disconnect detection with backoff.
4. Chunk ordering and session boundaries are enforced; out-of-order chunks are rejected.
5. Max session duration and max payload sizes are enforced client-side.
6. Failures trigger a safe fallback to file-based upload.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define streaming protocol spec (message schema, error codes, heartbeat) (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add optional Opus encoding path with negotiation and fallback to PCM (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement heartbeat + reconnect with exponential backoff (AC: 3)
- [ ] Enforce chunk/session ordering and size limits (AC: 4,5)
- [ ] Add safe fallback to file mode on stream failure (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Prefer WebSocket v1; gRPC is out of scope for now.
- Protocol spec can live in docs/api/streaming.md.

### Testing
- Integration: simulate dropped connections and ensure fallback.
- Manual: verify reconnection and error handling.
