# Epic 14 — Packaging & Auto-Update

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** reliable auto-update prompts and installs,
**so that** I can stay up to date with minimal friction.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App checks for updates on launch and on a reasonable interval (configurable).
2. Update feed/manifest format is defined and documented.
3. Update download and verification steps are implemented (checksum/signature).
4. User sees a minimal update prompt with clear actions (update now / later).
5. Update applies safely on restart without breaking existing data.
6. If update fails, the app recovers with a clear error state and manual fallback path.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define update feed/manifest format and hosting location (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement update check + download + verify flow in main process (AC: 1,3)
- [ ] Add minimal update prompt UX (AC: 4)
- [ ] Handle restart/apply and failure recovery paths (AC: 5,6)

## Dev Notes
- Prefer stable channel first; add beta channel only if required.
- Keep UI changes minimal and consistent with current UX.

### Testing
- Manual: simulate update available/no update, update success, update failure.
