# 6) Next Steps (recommended)

1. Run an **MVP readiness review** for Epics 1–3 (demo + known issues + p95 metrics + manual regression checklist).
2. Freeze the definition of “DONE” for M0, then shard Epics 4 and 7 into execution stories.
3. Keep this PRD updated at each milestone (changelog + epic status changes).
