# 2) Scope Principles (how to keep this global PRD actionable)

- This PRD covers **past / present / future** and stays actionable with `DONE / NOW / NEXT / LATER` tags.
- Detailed implementation work is created by **sharding** into execution-ready documents (epics → stories) under `docs/stories/`. Each epic includes a “Shard plan” listing suggested filenames to create there.
- Top priority (always): **latency + reliability + final-text quality + delivery robustness**, before moonshots (meetings, knowledge graph, deep automation).
